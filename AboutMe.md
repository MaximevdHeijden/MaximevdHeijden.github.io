Hi there! My name is Maxime van der Heijden, currently a PostDoctoral Researcher in Electrochemistry in the [Electrochemical Materials and Systems group](https://www.fornercuencaresearch.com/) at Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands. I obtained my PhD in December 2023 at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I worked on understanding and optimizing the three-dimensional structure of porous electrodes for redox flow batteries with the aim to design and synthesize novel electrodes with architected microstructures by using a combination of computer simulations and synthetic methods. 

Before my PhD I studied Chemical Engineering and Chemistry at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees. During my bachelor I worked on complex patterning of luminescent solar concentrators for improved aesthetics. For my master, with the focus on Molecular Systems and Materials Chemistry, I performed research on multi dye coordination in layered smectics for luminescent solar concentrator applications, followed by a study on receptive coatings for inkjet formulations during my internship at DSM Coating Resins in Waalwijk. For more information about me, please feel free to check out my [CV](/public/files/CV - M van der Heijden.pdf)!

Outside work you can find me walking with our dog Sagan, road cycling, running, gardening, cooking, traveling etc.
