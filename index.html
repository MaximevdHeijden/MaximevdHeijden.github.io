  The van der Heijden research group at the University of Waterloo is centered on the Advanced Manufacturing of Electrochemical Devices. Our research group focuses on the development of a framework for advanced manufacturing of porous microstructures for electrochemical devices, including water electrolyzers and flow batteries, to increase the implementation of these technologies in the energy industry. Our research bridges the gap between experimental and computational approaches by combining imaging techniques, machine learning, device testing, and additive manufacturing. We focus on three connected topics which include multiphase mass transport in porous materials, the design of porous materials using computational strategies, and the manufacturing of improved porous material design with great control over the structure and properties.
