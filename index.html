  Welcome to my website! 
  My name is Maxime and I am currently a PostDoctoral Researcher in Electrochemistry in the <a target="_blank" href="http://https://www.fornercuencaresearch.com/">Electrochemical Materials and Systems group</a> in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. 
</p>
</p>
   In my work I focus on the understanding and optimization of the three-dimensional structure of porous electrodes with the aim to design and synthesize next-generation electrodes for electrochemical devices by combining computer simulations and experimental methods.

  On my website you can find the algorithms that we developed and my ongoing projects. Feel free to give the codes a try and if you are interested in a collaboration don't hesitate to contact me!
